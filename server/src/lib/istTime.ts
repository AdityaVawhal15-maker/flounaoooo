/**
 * Clock arithmetic in the only timezone this product serves.
 *
 * Every time-of-day decision here was reading the server process's clock
 * through getHours() and getDay(). On a developer's machine in India that is
 * IST and everything looks right; on a VPS, which runs UTC by default, the
 * same code is five and a half hours out. Nothing throws, so it would have
 * shipped and quietly gone wrong: the timing advisor calling 8pm dinner-time
 * "mid-afternoon", price history filed under the wrong hour and, either side
 * of midnight, the wrong weekday, and a Monday-morning order counted against
 * last week's food budget.
 *
 * Setting TZ on the host would also work, but it fixes this in a place no
 * reader of this code can see, and one wrong deployment silently reintroduces
 * the whole class. Doing the arithmetic here cannot be undone by a config
 * file.
 *
 * A fixed offset is correct rather than a shortcut: India keeps one timezone
 * and has observed no daylight saving since 1945.
