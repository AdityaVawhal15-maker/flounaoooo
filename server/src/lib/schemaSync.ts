// Applying the schema before the server accepts a request.
//
// This exists because nothing else was doing it. The deploy ran build, generate
// and compile, and no migration in any phase — so the production database sat
// frozen at whatever schema someone last applied by hand, and every column added
// afterwards broke it. The symptom was brutal and misleading: login returned 500
// even for a WRONG password, because the lookup that should answer 401 selected
// a column the database did not have and threw before it could compare anything.
//
// It runs here, in the process, rather than as a platform pre-deploy hook,
// because the hook is configured in a dashboard this repository cannot see —
// a railway.json committed alongside it was silently overridden. Code is the one
// place the behaviour cannot be lost by a setting somebody forgot to carry
// across, and it works the same on any host.
//
// `db push` rather than `migrate deploy`: the migration history was generated
// against SQLite and its PRAGMA and DATETIME statements are rejected by
// Postgres, so it cannot be replayed there. Push diffs the live database
// against schema.prisma and applies the difference.
//
// Deliberately WITHOUT --accept-data-loss by default. Anything destructive
// fails, loudly, and the process exits rather than starting up having quietly
// dropped a column of real customer data.
//
// ACCEPT_SCHEMA_DATA_LOSS=1 is the escape hatch for a deploy that has already
// been reviewed and is known to be additive-only despite Prisma's classifier
// flagging it (e.g. a new unique index on a column with no rows yet). It is a
// one-deploy decision, not a standing setting — unset it again once applied.
