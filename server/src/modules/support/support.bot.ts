// Deterministic on purpose. A support surface has to give the same answer to
// the same question every time, has to work with no model API key configured,
// and must never be steerable by a customer typing instructions into it — all
// three rule out a free-form model here. What makes it useful instead of a FAQ
// dump is that it reads the customer's own orders, refunds and complaints, so
// "where is my order" gets answered with their order rather than with advice.
//
// It never claims to have done something it cannot do. Where the app has no
// mechanism (changing a sign-in address, tracing a bank hold), it says a person
// has to take it and offers the handover.
