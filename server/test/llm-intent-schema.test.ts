// The contract between the model and the recommender.
//
// This exists because of a bug that produced no error anywhere. `priority` was
// in the Zod intent type with `.default("balanced")`, and missing from the JSON
// schema the structured-output call is bound to. The model therefore could not
// return it, Zod filled the default, and every request reached the recommender
// as "balanced" — so "top-rated biryani" picked exactly what "cheapest biryani"
// picked, and nothing logged a thing.
//
// A default is the dangerous part: it turns a broken contract into a plausible
// answer. So the check is structural rather than behavioural — every field the
// intent type can carry must be requestable from the model.
