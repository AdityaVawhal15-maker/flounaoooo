// Marks for the platforms the engine searched.

// Drawn as inline SVG stand-ins rather than shipped as real logo files, for the
// same reason the payment marks are: the trademarks are not ours to bundle,
// and a vector keeps its edge at any size and in either theme. Each keeps its
// brand's own colour, because being recognisable at a glance is the entire job
// here.
//
// The point of showing them is evidence. "We compared these" is a claim, and a
// row of the actual places we looked is the proof of it. That is worth more to
// a person deciding whether to trust the answer than another sentence saying
// the same thing.
