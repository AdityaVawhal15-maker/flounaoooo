// at the same pace whether the answer took half a second or eight, and a
// completed tick beside work that had not happened is a small lie told four
// times per question.

// One line instead, shimmering, naming the phase it is actually in. The phases
// still advance on a timer, but a phase that lingers reads as a phase that is
// taking a while, which is true, where a tick that lingers reads as broken.

// there pulls the eye down to the thing the person is waiting on rather than
// the answer forming above it.
