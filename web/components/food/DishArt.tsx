// Dish artwork.
//
// A real photograph when the catalogue has one, and a drawn stand-in when it
// does not: a deterministic two-tone gradient with a glyph picked from the
// dish name, so the same dish always renders the same tile and the palette
// stays inside the brand's warm range.
//
// The fallback is not a placeholder to be removed later, it is the permanent
// answer for a dish whose photo is missing, slow, or 404s. An ONDC catalogue
// will not have a picture of everything, and a broken image icon in a list of
// food is worse than a tile that was designed.
//
// To add real photography: drop the file in `public/dishes/` and set `image`
// on the dish in the catalogue, e.g. "/dishes/dum-biryani.jpg". Nothing else
// needs changing; every surface passes the image through to here.
