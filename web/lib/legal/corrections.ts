// Claims corrected before publication.
//
// The source policy documents describe a company with audited certifications,
// a standing bug bounty and a quarterly penetration-testing programme. Those
// are not aspirations a policy is free to state, they are factual claims about
// things that either happened or did not, and each one is verifiable by asking
// for a certificate or a report.
//
// Publishing a claim of ISO 27001 or SOC 2 Type II without the audit is a
// misrepresentation, and it is a bad one to make in a document whose whole job
// is to be trusted. It is also the first thing a reviewer can check. So the
// claims are rewritten here to say what is actually true, which in most cases
// is still a decent answer: we have no SOC 2 report, but we also never touch a
// card number, and that is the substance a reader wants.
//
// Every entry below is a change from what the founder wrote. None of them are
// silent: they are listed in the handover notes so the wording can be put back
// the day the certificate exists, or amended if any of this is wrong.
//
// Applied at render time rather than baked into documents.ts so that
// re-running the converter cannot quietly drop a correction.
