// so a device that appears after a message was sent cannot read that message —
// that is the forward secrecy, and it is the correct behaviour. The practical
// consequence is that a device has to exist EARLY, not at the moment its owner
// first opens the chat, or they miss everything said in between.
//
// So this runs from the group screens too, not only the chat: being in the cart
// is what registers you, the way being in a WhatsApp group registers your
// phone whether or not you have the thread open.
